Each year, Americans cope with an average of 10,000 thunderstorms, 2,500 floods, 1,000 tornadoes, as well as an average of 6 deadly hurricanes. Potentially deadly weather impacts every American. Communities can now rely on the National Weather Service’s StormReady program to help them guard against the ravages of Mother Nature.

    Some 90% of all presidentially declared disasters are weather related,
    leading to around 500 deaths per year and nearly $14 billion in damage.
    StormReady, a program started in 1999 in Tulsa, OK,
    helps arm America's communities with the communication and safety
    skills needed to save lives and property– before and during the event.
    StormReady helps community leaders and emergency managers strengthen local safety programs.

    StormReady communities are better prepared to save lives from the onslaught of severe weather through better planning, education, and awareness. No community is storm proof, but StormReady can help communities save lives. Does StormReady make a difference?

    Americans live in the most severe
    weather-prone country on Earth. Each
    year, Americans cope with an average of
    10,000 thunderstorms, 2,500 floods,
    1,000 tornadoes, as well as an average
    of 6 deadly hurricanes. Potentially
    deadly weather impacts every American.
    Communities can now rely on the National
    Weather Service’s StormReady program to
    help them guard against the ravages of
    Mother Nature.

    Some 90% of all presidentially declared
    disasters are weather related, leading
    to around 500 deaths per year and nearly
    $14 billion in damage. StormReady, a
    program started in 1999 in Tulsa, OK,
    helps arm America's communities with the
    communication and safety skills needed
    to save lives and property– before and
    during the event. StormReady helps
    community leaders and emergency managers
    strengthen local safety programs.

    StormReady communities are better prepared to save lives from the onslaught of severe weather through better planning, education, and awareness. No community is storm proof, but StormReady can help communities save lives. Does StormReady make a difference?

    Americans live in the most severe weather-prone country on Earth. Each year, Americans cope with an average of 10,000 thunderstorms, 2,500 floods, 1,000 tornadoes, as well as an average of 6 deadly hurricanes. Potentially deadly weather impacts every American. Communities can now rely on the National Weather Service’s StormReady program to help them guard against the ravages of Mother Nature.

    Some 90% of all presidentially declared disasters are weather related, leading to around 500 deaths per year and nearly $14 billion in damage. StormReady, a program started in 1999 in Tulsa, OK, helps arm America's communities with the communication and safety skills needed to save lives and property– before and during the event. StormReady helps community leaders and emergency managers strengthen local safety programs.

    StormReady communities are better prepared to save lives from the onslaught of severe weather through better planning, education, and awareness. No community is storm proof, but StormReady can help communities save lives. Does StormReady make a difference?
